                <h2> Players </h2>
                    <p> The game requires at least 4 players, which will be divided in two teams.</p>
                    <p> For each round the team will have one captain, while the rest of the members will be crewmates.</p>

                <h2> Board</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The board has 25 words. From those: </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col s1"></div>
                        <ul class="col s11" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                            <li> 8 correspond to the <span class="blue">&nbsp;blue&nbsp;</span> team. </li>
                            <li> 8 correspond to the <span class="red">&nbsp;red&nbsp;</span> team. </li>
                            <li> 1 is a <span class="black">&nbsp;blacklist&nbsp;</span> word</li>
                            <li> 8 are neutral words </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        There are 2 boards. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Cremate's board: Is the paper one, placed on the table, visible to the whole team. </li>
                            <img src="crewmate-board.jpg" width="100%">
                            <li> Captains's board: Is the one on this web, and shows which words belong to which team. Only the captains will use this board. </li>
                            <img src="captains-board.png" width="100%">
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <h2> Objective </h2>
                    <p> The objective for each team is to guess all of the words that belong to their corresponding color. </p>
                    <p> When a team gueses all their words, the other team will add 1 point for every word they did not guess. </p>
                    <p> If a team gueses the black word, they will add 1 point for every word they did not guess, while the other team doesn't add any points. </p>
                    <p> The less points a team has, the better. </p>

                <h2> Gameplay </h2>
                    <p>Each time a new board is generated, a new captain is elected for each team.</p>
                    <p> The captain is in charge of picking a word that helps the team guess the most amount of words of their color, 
                        while trying to avoid their team saying words that belong any words that don't belong to their color. 
                        Besides saying a word, he needs to say the amount of words he believe can be associated with that word. </p>
                    <p> For example, in the above word, the captain could say <span style="text-decoration:underline"> "Countries 2" </span></p>
                    <p> 
                        The crewmates can guess the amount of words their captain indicates (in this case 2). 
                        If the crewmates pick a word that doesn't belong to their team, the color of the word is counted as "guessed", no matter the color, and their turn is over. 
                        If they guessed the black word, the whole round is over and the score should be calculated.
                        A captain can say "Countries infinite", if he wants his team to guess as many amount of words as they can.
